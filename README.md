# bootcampblues
Project 2
Purpose:
    This is an application to allow newcomers of a codeing bootcamp to get prepared and see what to expect. They will be able to read comments from their peers. This can help them be prepared for some of, and even understand the material better. Bootcamp Blues is a forum for learning developers to exchange information and discuss the challenges related to the course. As students in this course, we are well aware of the pressure and difficulties it presents. We wanted to make an application where students who are new to these subjects can have a helpful hub of information thatâ€™s easy to navigate. As a user I would like to be able to use this application to gain and share knowledge on the subjects covered in this bootcamp.
